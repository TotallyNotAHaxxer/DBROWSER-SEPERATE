Dark-browser
browse safely and securely encrypted using DARK-Browser

///////ABOUT///////

DBROWSER | Dark browser is a private browser made form python3, it uses tor service, proxychains, and a built vpn to connect to URI's and URL's, there are three options in the main file and framework, browse google | browse duckduckgo | browse my index | all of these come with the free will to browse with or without proxies, tor, and a vpn, i belive everyone should remain private and mass corperations promis and say yopu are secure when from personal experince and common knowledge i understand that you truly are not, their " built in vpn " is easy to trace to soemones location, and the encyption is easily crackable, so i developed a browser that uses proxy chains and vpn's to connect, i hope this project helps you
